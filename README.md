# Task 04 - Simple Keylogger

This is my fourth task in the Prodigy InfoTech Cybersecurity Internship.  
In this task, I created a simple keylogger in Python using the `pynput` library.

## About
The program listens to keyboard events and stores the pressed keys in a text file called `keyfile.txt`.  
It helped me understand how keylogging works and why such tools need to be handled responsibly in cybersecurity.

## Features
- Records keystrokes in real-time  
- Saves them to a log file  
- Works with both letters and special keys  

## How to Run
1. Install the required library:
2. Run the script:
3. Start typing, and the keys will be saved in `keyfile.txt`.

## Note
This project is made only for **educational purposes** as part of the internship.  
Keyloggers should never be used without permission.
